# Open Grant Proposal

* **Project Name:** Fundaria
* **Team Name:** Funda
* **Payment Address:** DAI address 0x07F8ad1a67580996bD403772d101041821850992

## Project Overview :page_facing_up: 

### Overview
Young startups often have problems with attracting funding at an early stage. If an young startup team wants to create specialized web page for their startup idea it is very difficult to find an opportunity to do this in a qualitatively structured form. Young startups have difficulties to find on the Web the opportunity to supply equity shares in the form of blockhain tokens using the intuitive interface. Existing investing in startups ecosystems are mostly closed, significantly limited in tools and opportunities, based on crusty investment traditions and unofficial rules. Fundaria intends to solve these problems and additionally includes business development system and market as core service components.

Fundaria develops architecture of smart contract template for startups to let supply equity shares in form of blockchain tokens and have their corporate finance pool on blockchain.

The Fundaria team envisages the transformation of established investment traditions at the global level in connection with the spread and development of decentralized systems.

### Project Details 
Fundaria has MVP version of the website which already allows statup teams to create "presentability" page for their startup.

### Ecosystem Fit 
Such projects, like Kickstarter, Weown, Funderbeam, Tokenization Assets Platform have similarities to Fundaria.
Fundaria advantages are:
- A project development can be started at the early stage of an idea (MVP exists already)
- Members of the community can apply to project teams (MVP exists already)
- Intuitive interface to supply shares in form of blockchain tokens with smart contract (developed MVP version for Ehtereum)
- Business development system for every individual startup including finance, project, times, team and assets management (alpha MVP exists already)
- The ability to pay off a project tasks with a project’s shares-tokens (bounty tasks) (MVP exists already)
- The platform can invest in a project, buying its shares-tokens
- Ideas contest with rewards in shares-tokens (MVP exists already)
- Guarantee of investors’ risks minimization encoded to smart contract (developed MVP version for Ehtereum)
- Advanced communication system "Chatik" with separate chat rooms for every startup and every startup's section, group chats and private chats (MVP exists already)

| Number | Deliverable | Specification |
| ------ | ----------- | ------------- |
| 0a  | License | Apache 2.0 / MIT / Unlicense |
| 0b. | Testing environment | We will provide testing tools (based on current implementation of such tools developed on current version of smart contract written on Solidity) to test all smart contract interaction scenarios and record the video of core testing |
| 0c. | Document/Tutorial | We will make document describing smart contract architecture and functionality and build in tutorial tips into web interface
| 1.  | Smart contract code | We will create smart contract code in !ink based on current implementation on Solidity based on document https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zOKRpq_9PJGUuaD4QoC5LQ2CYZhF6GSZbAk50hDLTVA/edit?usp=sharing  |  
| 2.  | Web interface | We will develop web interface for users (owner, investors, investment guides, delegated persons) to create their version of template smart contract and interact with it |
